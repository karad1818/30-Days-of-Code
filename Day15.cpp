/* OOP : Object Oriented Programming
      Video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFmuCDHHpwk
      
      
--> It's paradigm of programming based on Objects rather than functions
--> Pillars of OOP : 1.Encapsulation
                     2.Abstraction
                     3.Polymorphism
                     4.Inheritance
--> Problem in procedural programming : function dependency on too many functions that create too messy code.
    Here is solution : we bind all interrelated functions(Methods) and variable (Property) into one box  (This box is know as class (Object)) <-- this is known as encapsulation
    
--> Abstraction : Only Provide info. that are usefull (e.g. switch of fan )
--> Inherirance : eliminate redundent code 
--> Polymorphism : Poly (Many) + Morph(Forms)

Benefits : --> Encapsulation --> reduce complexity + increase reusability
               Polymorphism --> refactor switch case 
               Abstraction --> reduce complexity
               Inheritance --> eliminate redundant code
               

 --> Object is refenced type in js
